    title: The future of learning for the future!
    text: The mission of this institute is to integrate disparate approaches to studying intelligence—both bottom-up and top-down, learned and pre-specified effects, computational, quantitative, biological, and neuroscientific—in order to expand our ability to understand and engineer intelligent systems.
